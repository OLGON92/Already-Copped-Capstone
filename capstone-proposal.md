### Name of Student: Oscar Gonzalez

### Name of Project: Already Copped

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
* _It will allow users(sellers) to make listings for used sneakers, and streatwear. Other users(buyers) can look at listings, comment on listings, make an offer, or buy the item outright. Sellers can upload pictures, give a small description of the item, list any defects or pertinent information along those lines for their item, and set a price. There will also be admins who will authenticate shoe listings by looking at the photos the seller sends.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Working site
* Authenticates users and admins
* Allows certain user privileges, and admin privileges
* Allows users to make listings
* Allows users to make comments on listings as a means to contact the seller
* Allows users to buy or make offers

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* React/JSX
* Auth0 or Firebase
* React Router 
* VS Code 
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Redux

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: 
* Make my own API that works in conjunction with the web app
* Use email services to log-in
* Make it so that users can also upload videos
* Utilize a real-time database
* Use a cloud-based file storage 
* Maybe use an AI to authenticate shoes?

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Firebase Storage
* Swagger
* Firebase Realtime Database
* SendGrid

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
