### Overview
_This is a web app that would allow you to post a listing to sell either used shoes or articles of clothing. It is mainly geared to the streetwear scene. Users can upload photos, along with a small description, and any known defects, marks, scuffs, etc. Buyers can make an offer, buy, or make comments on posts as a means to interact with the seller. Fakes, or reps, are a problem in the sneaker community; admins will have to approve sneaker postings by examining the the various photos on the listing, and possibly contacting the seller for more as a means to mitigate the un-warranted sale of any fakes._
